    <strong>ABOUT ME:</strong>
    <p>I am a senior (crying) here at CU Boulder. I am outgoing and creative, I love to design and spend time with my friends.</p>

    <strong>GOALS FOR THIS COURSE:</strong>
    <p>I would love to become confortable with coding and to feel like I know what I'm doing. Coding is really challenging for me, so I am excited to build my skills this semester.</p>
